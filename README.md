Business Listings Scraper
Overview
This script is a web scraper designed to extract business contact information from publicly available web pages. It uses Puppeteer with stealth plugins to minimize detection and ensure smooth scraping. The extracted data includes:

The results are saved in a structured JSON format for easy use in data analysis or business intelligence applications.

Features
